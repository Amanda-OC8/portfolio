From a React's Course, I learned about Gatsby, and I wanted to work on my own with the framework. I used a template from the gatsby web page to have a base with the front-end. I like to work with front-end libraries like boostrap to focus on the development of others elements before than general structure and distribution. One of these elements is the color scheme. I choosed a color scheme without big contrast between dark and light colors to avoid a dark mode and that be suitable for colour blind people. I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) as always.

I choosed the gatsby-blog template, not the portfolio-dev because this work using an external CMS and I already worked with one on the course. The gastby blog works with the Markdown technology and I was curious about them and I thought that was a great opportunity to wrk with it. However, I used the portfolio as base for the structure, because if it ain't broken don't fix it.

One of the features I wanted to implement was a switch language. For my studies and works, I use to work in english, but I speak and live using spanish. For this reason I implemented the switch and also because I can test and designed a multilingual site. The switching is made using the state with two options, true and false. This can be escalated to a more complex switching using an array. Although spanish is my mother tongue, mostly of the web development is made with english and for this reason the predeterminate language is it.

In the front-end, I used the card distribution for the different projects following the portfolio-dev template, and using the blog structure to create a page with a detailed text about the design and development of each project. The responsive design is mine, and the toggle menu on the mobile version was a bit more complex than I expected but I can resolve successfully.

I faced other difficulties, as incompatibilities between plugins and my OS. I resolved these problems with my javascript abilities and adapting my code to reach my objective. On the other hand, I found the work using Markdown very satisfactory because is a simple and powerfull technology that allows make great things. You can view the code of the project on my git-hub [git-hub](https://github.com/Amanda-OC8/portfolio) and you can view them going to the [home page](/).
