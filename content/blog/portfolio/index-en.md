This portfolio was other project. From a React's Course I earned about Gatsby and I want to try to work on my own with the framework. I use a template from the gatsby web page to has a base with the front-end. I like to work with front-end libraries like boostrap to not focus the development of the size elements, i.e. It's thankfully that a library give me the ideals size and element distribution to the design and from there, I can personalize other elements, like the colors scheme (using a limited palette from coolors.co).

I choose the gatsby-blog template not the portfolio-dev because the first works with markdown, a technology about I'm curious and I think is a great opportunity to start to works. However, I use the portfolio-dev template as model to the web structure, becuase, I one thing isn't broke, not try to fix them.

One of the feuature I want to implement is a switch language. For my studies and works, I used to work in english, but sometimes I miss to wrok and think on my native language (spanish) and for these reason I made an english and a spanish version of this web-site with a simple switch.

I use the card distribution for the different projects following the portfolio-dev template, using the blog structure to create a page with a detaliled text about the desgin and develompent of each project. The responsive design is on my own, and the toggle menu on the mobile version is a bit complex but I can resolve successfully.

Other difficult is manage the switch language. After various errors with my OS, finally I manage the switch with the state of the app, and a filtering of the page content. As I make a detalied text from all the projects, is more easy duplicate the texts for the switch using the english as the default language.
