After the Bootcamp, I want to improve my abilities on the front-end. For these reason I searched for courses related with React, the principal framework that we learnt on the Iron Hack Bootcamp. I found this course to improve these abilities. The course has different type of projects. The most basics allow me to refresh the basic concepts of React. The most complex allow me to learn new frameworks, as Next.js and Gatsby.

Some projects use APIs that I never imagined to use and test and are a best practice to refresh the knowledges from the Bootcamp. The Bootcamp's leasson are very intenses and can investigate without a deadline to optimize the apps is interesenting. 

Other new knowledge of the course is the use of styled components, that we not know in the Bootcamp, again, for low time we have. 

The apps created are the following:
1. __[Appointment manage](https://appointment-manage.netlify.app/)__:An app to create medical appiotnments to your pet. Only front-end, without backend to store the data between sesions.
2. __[Cryptocurrency conversor](https://cryptocurrency-conversor.netlify.app/)__:An app with to converert cryptocurrency in real money. Again, no back-end but the data is calling using an API
3. __[Budget managment](https://budget-managment.netlify.app/)__:An app to manage a budget. Again, no back-end but a more complex that previous projects with conditional views and a bit complex state.
4. __[Weather App](https://wheater-app-consultant.netlify.app/)__:An app to consult the weather using an external API. In this project I changed the outputs to a more relevant data.
5. __[Pixabay search](https://pixabay-search-images.netlify.app/)__:An app to search on the website Pixabay using their API. The challenge on this project was create the card to adjust to different size without deforming the image.
6. __[MERN task](https://merntask-client.netlify.app/)__: An app to create and manage prokects. This app has a back-end part (manage on heroku) to store the different projects and allows user registration for this.
7. __[Product Hunt Clone](https://product-hunt-clone-next.netlify.app/)__: A clone of the website Product Hunt to search and recommend different types of products. This websaite use Next.js as framework
8. __[Gatsby Hotel](https://gatsby-hotel1.netlify.app/)__: An app to manage a small Hotel. This website use Gatsby as front-end and DatoCMS as back-end and was the inspiration to use Gatsby as framework for this portfolio.
