Hi! I'm Amanda Ordóñez Cencerrado, previous physicits, now a web developers. Like many others, I started my physics studies because I want to became astronomer, only to discovers that the cosmology are more related to mathematics than to the school physics. But this not desmotivated me, only I need to investigate what branch of the physics love more. 

I compaginated this search with a volunteer activity on a Scout's Group. I started as consuelor activity and became the coordinator of the Group. I principally worked with teenagers (12-17 years olds) but I also prepared activities for children (7-11 years old). As coordinator manage with a team of ten people, and talk with the parents of the children and other institutions, as the regional organization. I did this coordinate activities during the schoolar-year projects, and work as monitor on the summer camps, with marchs of various days and other fields activities.

On my last year of university I discoverd my passion, the geophysics, the study of the earth activities, from the ground to the space. To complete my formation, I made the Geophysics Master on the University. I learned about sysmology, magnetism, tectonics, geophysics and programming with MATLAB. In this moment I has a very basic knowledge about the software and programming, but I start to studied on my own. The intership practices I made are deveolping from zero a software on MATLAB to proccess and represent georeferencial data,from a georadar data that I process with their own software. 

When I was writing my Final Master Thesis, I started a process to work as formation student on the Magnetism Laboratory from the [INTA](https://www.inta.es/INTA/en/index.html) (Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial), where I finally start to work. During two years I worked with MATLAB, with magnetic simulations, and learned about the reaseacrh work on an unique enviroment, as the Spanish's Spacial Agency. When the contract end, I change, through a serie of public contest-oposition, to work as Superior technician on the Labotory on an Horizon 2020 International project. I work with a team from different three countries and six different public and private institutions to develeop a novel technology on the magentic measurements. I work woth the hardware and the software.

I have new functions. One of them was work on the development of a novel instrument. I worked on the calibration proccess, where we musrt designed and built our own calibration pattern samples because not exist pattern with the susceptibility characterictis necessarries for our instrument. Also, I learnt to use the simulation software ANSYS, specifically the Maxweell' package of electromagnetic simulation. Othe of my functions was start to work with the VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer). The VSM is a complex instrumente that make very different types of magnetics test. The software is old and for these reason I start to develop different programs on MATLAB to improve the data proccessing. The final steps I reached were the development of GUIs, searchinf how on my own, to simplify the proccessing, and varying according the type of test. In this moment I discoverd that I really love the software development more that the pure investigation. This, with a vital stagnation after various years centered on investigation make that I make a change on my carrer

Research and web development are similars: the challanges, the community to share and the need of make better the world. Both use the logical thinkjing and the works methodologies are similar. The advantage of the software develmpeont it is more inmidate that the reasearch, because you can see the results on months before on years. Also, the software is more sastifactory to me because it can developed on anywhere, only need a computer. In the reasearch (more in magnetic reasearch) you need a deditacted and delicate software and hardware to work, indeed a big spaces to manage the equipment. I miss some aspects of the reasearch, as the field work, but I discoverd a new challenge world on the software development.

I finally choose to join the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Iron Hack, where I will learn a complete formation (Back End and Front End) and the last knowloedge on JavaScript. I like the methodology of work on the Bootcamp and Iron Hack and I very happy with the formation and how I learn to develop SPA, like this portfolio, thanks to the Bootcamp.
