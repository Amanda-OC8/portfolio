Hi! I'm Amanda Ordóñez Cencerrado, before physicist, now a web developer. Like many others, I started my physics studies because I want to become an astronomer, only to discover that the cosmology are more related to mathematics than I thought. But this didn't demotivate me, only motivated me to look for a new branch of physics that would excite me.

I combined my studies with a volunteer activity on the Scout's Group Calasanz-Val on my natal town, Alcalá de Henares where I have lived most of my life. I started as counsellor-activity (along my first university year, I made the course) and became the coordinator of the Group. I principally worked with teenagers (12-17 years old) but I also prepared activities for younger children (7-11 years old). As the coordinator manages a team about ten people, and talk with the parents of the children and other institutions, as the Scout's regional organization (Scouts de Madrid). I did this coordinate activities during the schoolar-year projects, and work as monitor on the summer camps, with walks of various days and other fields activities.

I continued my searching of a new branch of physics and on my last year of university I finally discovered my passion, the geophysics. Geophysics is the study of the earth activities, from the ground to the space. To complete my formation, I made a Geophysics Master. I learned about seismology, magnetism, tectonics, geophysics and programming with MATLAB. In this moment I had a very basic knowledge about the software and programming, but I started to study on my own. On my internship practices on Geofísica Consultores I developed from zero a software on MATLAB to process and represent georeferencing data, using the data from a geo radar that I previously processed with their own software.

When I was writing my Final Master Thesis, I started a process to work as formation student on the Magnetism Laboratory from the [INTA](https://www.inta.es/INTA/en/index.html) (Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial), where I finally started to work. During two years I worked with MATLAB, with magnetic simulations and learned about the research work on a unique environment working on international projects. When the contract end, I changed, through a series of public contest-oposition, to work as Superior technician on the Magnetism Laboratory on a Horizon 2020 International project, the [NEWON Project](http://www.h2020-newton.eu/). I worked with a team from different three countries and six different public and private institutions to develop a novel technology on the magnetic measurements. My work implied the development of hardware and software.

The project NEW portable multi-sensor scienTific instrument for non-invasive ON-site characterization of rock from planetary surface and sub-surfaces (NEWTON) aims at developing a new portable and compact multi-sensor instrument for ground breaking high resolution magnetic characterisation of planetary surfaces and sub-surfaces through the combination of complex susceptibility and vector measurements. The project goes beyond the state-of-the-art technology by introducing magnetic susceptometry as a complement to existing compact vector magnetometers for planetary exploration. With this, NEWTON gives the first opportunity to perform high resolution and complete non-invasive in-situ magnetic characterization of planetary surfaces and subsurfaces. This non-invasive characterization provides unique scientific information on some of the main objectives related to the Solar System exploration roadmap such as the intense magnetic crustal anomalies of Mars and the strongly discussed formation of its moons.

In this new job, I had new functions. One of them was work on some of the steps of the development of a novel instrument. Some of my functions were, for example, the instrument's calibration process, where we must designed and built our own calibration pattern samples because not exist of pattern with the susceptibility characteristics necessary for our instrument. Also, I learnt to use the simulation software ANSYS, specifically the Maxwell' package of electromagnetic simulation. Other of my functions was start to work more close with the VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer). The VSM is a complex instrument that make very different types of magnetics test. The software is old and for this reason I started to develop different programs on MATLAB to improve the data processing. The final steps I reached were the development of GUIs, learning on my own, to simplify the processing, and made the software on the most reusable way. In this moment I discovered that I really loved the software development more that the investigation. This, coupled with a stagnation in my life after several years focused on research, led me to consider a change in my career.

Research and web development are similar: the challenges, the community to share and the need of make better the world. Both use similar work methodologies, as the logical thinking. The advantage of the software development it is more imidate that the research, because you can see the results in months before in years. Also, the software is more satisfactory to me because it can developed on anywhere, only need a computer. In the research (more in magnetic research) you need a specific and delicate software and hardware to work, indeed a big space to manage the equipment. I miss some aspects of the research, as the field work, but I discovered a new challenge world on the software development.

I finally choose to join the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Iron Hack, where I learnt a complete formation (Back End and Front End) and the last knowledge on JavaScript. I like the methodology of work on the Bootcamp and Iron Hack and I very happy with the formation and how I learn to develop SPA, like this portfolio, thanks to the Bootcamp learnings.
